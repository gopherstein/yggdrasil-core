# Yggdrasil Core — AI Experience Platform

## Feature Specification

### Status

**Type:** Platform Architecture / Product Experience  
**Primary goal:** Build the infrastructure around interchangeable local models so Yggdrasil behaves like one coherent AI system rather than a collection of model runtimes.

**Primary subsystems:**
- **Huginn** — orchestration, routing, planning, verification
- **Muninn** — memory, conversation context, context assembly
- **Mimir** — knowledge retrieval / RAG
- **Gungnir** — tools, capabilities, permissions, providers
- **Norn** — scheduling, placement, execution routing
- **Heimdall** — health, diagnostics, failure recovery
- **Gjallarhorn** — notifications and delivery

---

## 1. Product Goal

Yggdrasil should make a local model feel like a complete AI product.

The model itself is one interchangeable component inside a broader system. A normal user should not need to understand system prompts, context windows, memory retrieval, tool schemas, model routing, structured outputs, retries, hardware placement, providers, artifacts, citations, or connector credentials.

The desired experience is:

```text
Ask Yggdrasil for something
        ↓
gather the right context
        ↓
choose the right model and tools
        ↓
execute on the right hardware
        ↓
verify when useful
        ↓
return a polished answer or artifact
```

> **Local AI should feel like a complete service, not a raw model endpoint.**

---

## 2. Why This Matters

A raw model generates tokens. A strong AI product also provides:

- continuity,
- current information,
- tools,
- memory,
- retrieval,
- planning,
- verification,
- failure recovery,
- background execution,
- notifications,
- integrations,
- artifact handling,
- polished presentation.

Yggdrasil should deliberately own those layers.

Conceptually:

```text
Models
= interchangeable intelligence

Yggdrasil
= context
+ memory
+ retrieval
+ tools
+ permissions
+ orchestration
+ routing
+ recovery
+ scheduling
+ notifications
+ integrations
+ UX
```

# Part II — Instruction and Policy Layer

## 5. Request Instruction Stack

Every model request should be assembled from product-controlled layers:

```text
Yggdrasil system policy
+ profile instructions
+ tool-use constraints
+ permission policy
+ relevant context
+ conversation history
+ current user message
```

This should be consistent across runtimes.

Critical policy should be enforced outside the model wherever possible.

Examples:

```text
Model requests email.send
→ Gungnir checks permission

Model requests unavailable tool
→ execution layer rejects it

Model returns invalid structured data
→ validator rejects or repairs it
```

---

# Part III — Context Assembly and Compression

## 6. Context Builder

Muninn should assemble only useful context.

Possible sources:

- recent turns,
- summaries of older turns,
- persistent memories,
- project context,
- relevant files,
- Mimir results,
- tool results,
- active task state.

Do not dump all known context into every prompt.

---

## 7. Context Budget

Each request should explicitly budget context:

```text
available context
   ↓
reserve:
- system instructions
- current request
- response budget
   ↓
allocate remainder:
- recent conversation
- memory
- retrieval
- tool results
```

Prefer relevance over raw recency.

---

## 8. Conversation Compression

When context pressure grows:

- keep full original history in storage,
- summarize older conversation for prompt use,
- preserve decisions, commitments, facts, and unresolved tasks,
- allow the summary to be regenerated from source history,
- avoid repeatedly summarizing summaries where practical.

---

## 9. Provenance

Injected context should retain provenance:

```text
conversation
memory
file
knowledge retrieval
tool result
project context
```

This supports debugging and citations.

---

# Part IV — Persistent Memory

## 10. Persistent Memory

Muninn should support durable memory independent of the model.

Examples:

- user preferences,
- project facts,
- recurring workflows,
- hardware information,
- prior decisions.

Recommended modes:

```text
Memory On
→ conversation + relevant persistent memory

Memory Off
→ conversation only
```

Turning memory off should not delete stored memory.

---

## 11. Explicit and Automatic Memory

Support direct instructions such as:

```text
Remember that this project uses Go.
```

Future automatic extraction should be conservative, editable, removable, deduplicated, and provenance-aware.

---

# Part V — Task Classification and Model Routing

## 12. Task Classification

Huginn should classify requests before deciding how to execute them.

Possible classes:

```text
simple chat
current-information lookup
coding
data analysis
document creation
image/audio task
research
multi-step workflow
external action
scheduled/background task
```

Simple tasks should stay simple.

---

## 13. Automatic Model Routing

Potential roles:

```text
default
fast
reasoning
coding
vision
long-context
planner
worker
reviewer
```

Selection may consider:

- task type,
- installed models,
- capability metadata,
- context limits,
- health,
- hardware fit,
- current load,
- expected speed,
- community model ratings,
- profile preferences.

A single model may fill multiple roles.

---

## 14. Fallback Routing

A bounded fallback sequence may be:

```text
preferred model
    ↓
same model on another node
    ↓
alternate quantization
    ↓
alternate compatible model
    ↓
smaller fallback model
    ↓
user-visible failure
```

---

# Part VI — Adaptive Reasoning

## 15. Reasoning Budget

The system should decide how much orchestration a task deserves.

```text
"What is DNS?"
→ direct model call

"Compare five architectures and produce a decision memo."
→ planning + retrieval + verification
```

Optional user-facing control:

```text
Auto
Fast
Balanced
Thorough
```

Default: **Auto**.

These modes should map to orchestration budgets, not expose internal call counts.

---

# Part VII — Tool Selection, Permissions, and Execution

## 16. Relevant Tool Selection

Gungnir/Huginn should expose or select only relevant tools when practical.

Example:

```text
Spreadsheet request
→ files.read
→ spreadsheet.analyze
→ spreadsheet.create
```

Avoid exposing every tool to every call.

---

## 17. Permission Model

Permissions are enforced outside the model.

Suggested states:

```text
Allow
Ask
Deny
```

Example:

```text
web.search      Allow
files.read      Allow
files.write     Ask
email.send      Ask
shell.execute   Ask
```

The model cannot broaden its own permissions.

---

## 18. Capability-First Tool IDs

Prefer:

```text
image.generate
speech.transcribe
email.search
calendar.create
```

over provider-specific names.

Providers should be interchangeable.

---

## 19. Tool Runtime

Common execution path:

```text
tool request
   ↓
schema validation
   ↓
permission check
   ↓
provider selection
   ↓
Norn placement
   ↓
execute
   ↓
normalize result
```

The runtime should support:

- timeout,
- cancellation,
- progress,
- structured results,
- artifacts,
- normalized errors.

Tools may execute on another Yggdrasil node.

---

# Part VIII — Retrieval and Current Information

## 20. Mimir Knowledge Retrieval

Mimir should retrieve relevant user/project knowledge from:

```text
local files
uploaded documents
project indexes
knowledge bases
connected storage
```

---

## 21. Current Information

Gungnir should expose current-information tools such as:

```text
web search
weather
maps
business lookup
financial data
package tracking
```

Huginn determines when external retrieval is required.

Retrieval ranking should consider relevance, freshness, source quality, and scope.

---

# Part IX — Multi-Step Orchestration

## 22. Planning

Create a plan only when useful.

Example:

```text
Find three NAS drives,
compare price/TB,
create a spreadsheet.
```

Potential plan:

```text
1. Find candidates
2. Gather specs/prices
3. Normalize values
4. Calculate price/TB
5. Compare
6. Create spreadsheet
```

---

## 23. Parallel Workers

Independent work may execute concurrently.

Example:

```text
Research Ollama
Research llama.cpp
Research MLX
Research vLLM
       ↓
    Synthesize
```

Possible worker roles:

```text
researcher
coder
data analyst
critic
writer
```

Workers may use different models, tools, and nodes.

---

# Part X — Verification and Critique

## 24. Verification Layer

Huginn may perform a second pass for:

- calculations,
- source consistency,
- generated code,
- contradictions,
- completeness,
- tool success,
- multi-agent synthesis,
- high-impact actions.

Verification should be selective rather than mandatory for every message.

---

# Part XI — Failure Recovery

## 25. Heimdall Integration

Heimdall should expose health for:

```text
models
nodes
runtimes
tools
providers
```

Huginn/Norn should use these signals to route around unhealthy resources.

Retries should be bounded, error-aware, and observable.

---

## 26. Graceful Degradation

Examples:

```text
multi-agent unavailable
→ single model

preferred provider unavailable
→ alternate provider

large model unavailable
→ smaller compatible model
```

If degradation materially changes expected quality, tell the user.

---

# Part XII — Structured Output Validation

## 27. Structured Results

Automations/tools may need machine-readable data:

```json
{
  "price": 420,
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

Users should not need to see internal schemas.

Validation should include:

- schema checks,
- type checks,
- required fields,
- safe repair/retry.

User-facing rendering:

```text
The current price is $420.
```

---

# Part XIII — Artifact Management

## 28. Unified Artifact Store

Use one abstraction for:

```text
documents
PDFs
spreadsheets
images
audio
video
code files
archives
```

Conceptual metadata:

```text
Artifact
  id
  type
  mime_type
  name
  size
  created_at
  producer
  source_task
  storage_location
```

Support temporary and persistent artifacts, export/download, cross-tool use, and conversation attachments.

---

# Part XIV — Citations and Provenance

## 29. Source Tracking

Retrieved information should retain source metadata.

Possible source types:

```text
web
file
memory
knowledge base
email
calendar
tool result
```

Citation rendering should be a product feature rather than asking the model to invent citation syntax.

---

# Part XV — Scheduling and Notifications

## 30. Background Execution

Scheduled tasks should use the same stack as interactive tasks:

```text
Norn schedules
→ Huginn orchestrates
→ Muninn/Mimir provide context
→ Gungnir runs tools
→ Heimdall watches health
→ Gjallarhorn delivers result
```

Avoid creating a separate scheduler-specific AI stack.

---

## 31. Notifications

Gjallarhorn should support:

```text
in-app
desktop
mobile push
email
webhook
```

Notification policy may be:

```text
always
condition true
result changed
failure
store only
```

---

# Part XVI — Connectors and Authentication

## 32. Connected Services

Examples:

```text
Gmail
Google Calendar
GitHub
Slack
Drive
Notion
Home Assistant
```

Credentials must remain outside model context.

Preferred flow:

```text
model requests capability
      ↓
Gungnir resolves connector
      ↓
connector uses stored credential
      ↓
sanitized result returns
```

Use narrow permission scopes where available.

---

# Part XVII — UI Presentation

## 33. Human-Friendly Activity

Raw execution should be translated into simple UX.

Raw:

```json
{
  "tool": "spreadsheet.analyze",
  "rows": 1482
}
```

User sees:

```text
Analyzing spreadsheet…
✓ 1,482 rows analyzed
```

Normal users should see concise states such as:

```text
Searching…
Analyzing…
Generating…
Verifying…
Creating file…
```

Advanced users can expand technical details.

---

## 34. Error Presentation

Prefer:

```text
I couldn't reach the website. I'll try again on the next scheduled run.
```

over:

```text
ECONNRESET
```

Technical details belong in Diagnostics.

---

# Part XVIII — Observability

## 35. Run Tracing

Every orchestrated request should have a run ID.

Conceptual:

```text
Run
  id
  conversation_id
  profile_id
  strategy
  models_used
  tools_used
  nodes_used
  started_at
  completed_at
  status
```

Advanced run details may show:

```text
Planner: Qwen Reasoning
Workers: 3
Tools: web.search, code.execute
Nodes: MacBook, GPU workstation
Verification: 1 pass
Retries: 0
```

Useful metrics include:

- latency,
- TTFT,
- model load time,
- tokens/sec,
- tool duration,
- retry count,
- context size,
- cache hits.

---

# Part XIX — Caching

## 36. Cache Layer

Potential cache targets:

```text
tool metadata
model capability metadata
retrieval indexes
public model ratings
download metadata
safe external lookups
```

Each cache should define:

```text
key
TTL
invalidation policy
scope
privacy level
```

---

# Part XX — Capability Discovery

## 37. Unified Capability Inventory

Yggdrasil should know:

```text
which models exist
which nodes are online
which tools exist
which providers are healthy
which connectors are authorized
which artifacts are accessible
```

Huginn should be able to ask capability questions without hardcoding providers.

Examples:

```text
Can I generate an image?
Can I execute Python?
Can I access email?
Which node can run this model?
```

---

# Part XXI — Personalization

## 38. Personalization Sources

Personalization may use:

- profile configuration,
- persistent memory,
- response-style preferences,
- preferred tools,
- project context,
- recurring workflows.

Preferences and permissions must remain separate.

Example:

```text
User frequently uses email
```

does **not** imply:

```text
email.send = allowed
```

---

# Part XXII — Default User Experience

## 39. Zero-Configuration Default

Recommended defaults:

```text
Model selection        Auto
Tools                  Auto within permissions
Memory                 On
Context                 Auto
Reasoning               Auto
Planning                Auto
Verification            Auto
Placement               Auto
Fallbacks               Auto
```

Example user request:

```text
Compare the top three options and make me a spreadsheet.
```

Visible:

```text
Researching…
Comparing results…
Creating spreadsheet…
✓ Done
```

Invisible:

```text
classification
model routing
retrieval
parallel work
calculation
artifact generation
verification
```

---

# Part XXIII — Advanced Controls

# Part XXVII — Acceptance Criteria

## 55. Default Experience

The platform is successful when:

1. A new user gets useful results without configuring orchestration.
2. Relevant conversation context is assembled automatically.
3. Older history can be compressed without deleting source history.
4. Persistent memory survives model changes.
5. Simple and complex requests are treated differently.
6. Models can be routed automatically.
7. Relevant tools can be selected automatically.
8. Permissions are enforced outside the model.
9. Structured outputs are validated before use.
10. Complex tasks can use planning and parallel work.
11. Important outputs can be verified.
12. Model/tool/node failures can trigger bounded fallback.
13. Generated artifacts are handled consistently.
14. Retrieved information retains provenance.
15. Scheduled tasks use the same orchestration stack.
16. Background results can flow through Gjallarhorn.
17. Connector credentials remain isolated from model context.
18. Tool/model activity is rendered in human-readable UI.
19. Advanced users can inspect run details.
20. The user experiences one coherent assistant rather than infrastructure components.

---

## 56. Advanced Experience

Advanced users should be able to inspect or configure:

```text
model routing
role-specific models
tool permissions
context/memory behavior
reasoning budget
planning
parallelism
verification
placement
retries
fallbacks
providers
run traces
```

---

## 57. Reliability

The system should:

- avoid infinite retries,
- avoid repeated OOM loops,
- preserve useful partial results,
- surface meaningful failures,
- separate task failure from notification failure,
- remain functional when optional hosted services are unavailable.

---

# Part XXVIII — Additional Requirements

These requirements came out of building Mimir and Train Your Own AI (#48, #51) against this specification.

## 58. Retrieved Content Is Data, Not Instructions

Web pages, files, Mimir passages, tool results, memories, and connector data can contain text that reads like instructions. Context assembly must keep them from being treated as instructions.

- Every Context Bundle item (§42) carries a trust level: **trusted** (Yggdrasil policy, profile and specialized-AI instructions, the user's own message) or **untrusted** (everything retrieved or returned by a tool).
- Untrusted content is never placed in the system role. It is delimited, labelled with its source, and introduced as reference material.
- A tool call that follows untrusted content is held to the stricter permission: an Allow tool that would act externally (send, write, execute, purchase) becomes Ask for that call.
- Tool results that contain instructions are passed through as data; the model is told they are data.

## 59. Permission Requests When Nobody Is Watching

Background and scheduled runs have no person present to answer an **Ask** permission.

- Automations record the permissions they need when created, and the person approves them then.
- A run that reaches an unapproved Ask either pauses and sends an approval request through Gjallarhorn, or skips the action and reports it, according to the automation's policy. The default is to skip and report.
- A run never widens its permissions because no one answered.

## 60. Sharing the Computer

Interactive chat, background automations, benchmarks, and training compete for the same memory.

- Priority: interactive chat > scheduled automations > benchmarks > training.
- Lower-priority work queues instead of evicting a model an interactive chat is using.
- Training may unload models only when no interactive request is active; a chat that arrives during training is served (possibly on another computer) or told plainly that training is using this computer, with an estimate.
- Repeated out-of-memory failures stop the retry loop (§57) and are explained.

## 61. Specialized AIs and Supporting Models in Routing

Model routing (§13) must understand:

- **Specialized AIs** (`sai:<name>`): a base model plus a LoRA adapter that exists only on the computer that owns it, with tools off and its own instructions and knowledge. Routing must not place it where its adapter is missing or route tool-requiring tasks to it.
- **Supporting roles**: `embedding` and `reranker` models used by Mimir, and the `classifier` model (if any) used by Huginn.
- Adapter-aware placement: base model processes load the adapters of deployed AIs, so the base model and its specialized AIs share one process.

## 62. The API Gets the Same Assistant

`/v1/chat/completions` must pass through the standard request pipeline (§46):

- The full message array is honored, not only the last user message.
- Callers can opt into memory and connected knowledge per request or per API key.
- Progress and tool activity are available to streaming clients (as OpenAI-compatible tool-call deltas or a Yggdrasil extension field).
- Advanced controls (reasoning level, tools, placement) are settable per request within the key's permissions.

## 63. What Left This Computer

Yggdrasil is local-first, so each run records where its data went:

- web searches and page fetches (queries and URLs),
- paired computers that received prompts, context, or training examples,
- external OpenAI-compatible servers,
- connectors.

Memories and knowledge sources can be marked **this computer only**; Norn must not place work that needs them elsewhere. Run records store prompts and tool results, so they need a retention period and a delete action.

## 64. Quality Test Set

Classification, routing, context assembly, verification, and reasoning budgets all change answers. A fixed set of representative requests with expected behavior (a simple question stays direct; a price question uses knowledge; a risky action asks first; a long conversation remembers an early fact) runs against the stub model in CI and against real models on a schedule, so defaults are changed with evidence (§54).

## 65. Latency Targets

The platform must not make the common case slower.

- Pipeline overhead before the first token of a simple chat: at most 100 ms over a direct model call, measured on the quality test set.
- Classification for simple chats uses rules or a cached decision, not an extra model call.
- Visible progress appears within 300 ms of sending, even when the model is loading.

## 66. Accurate Token Counting

Context budgets (§7) use the running model's tokenizer (llama-server `/tokenize`) when available, falling back to estimates only when it is not.

## 67. Stop Means Stop

Cancelling a run stops every worker, tool call, and remote computer involved, releases their resources, and keeps the partial results already produced.

## 68. Versioned Client Contract

Desktop and mobile apps are separate clients. Run, progress, artifact, and citation events carry a contract version, and fields are added compatibly.

## Additional Acceptance Criteria

21. Retrieved content cannot change the assistant's instructions or widen a tool's permission.
22. Background runs never wait silently for, or skip past, an Ask permission.
23. Interactive chat is not evicted by background work or training.
24. Specialized AIs are routed only where their adapter exists.
25. API clients get conversation history, memory, and knowledge when they ask for them.
26. Each run can show what data left the computer and where it went.
27. Simple chats stay within the latency targets.

# Part XXIX — Implementation Priority

All items, ordered by how much a person using chat will notice them. The standard request pipeline (§46) and Context Bundle (§42) are foundations built incrementally as these land, not a separate first step.

**Every chat**

1. Answers show their sources: web pages, knowledge passages, files, and memories, rendered by the product (§9, §29).
2. Progress in plain language while working, and a "what I did" summary kept with each answer (§33).
3. Errors in plain language with a next step and a retry; technical detail on request (§34).
4. Simple chats stay fast (§65).
5. Long conversations keep working: context budget, compression of older turns, accurate token counts (§6–8, §66).
6. Memory that survives model changes: "Remember that…", Memory on/off, memory management (§10–11).
7. "Auto" picks the right model and looks things up when needed: task classification, model routing, current information (§12–13, §21).
8. Failures recover quietly: fallback routing, Heimdall health, graceful degradation, and a note when quality changes (§14, §25–26).

**Powerful tasks**

9. Retrieved content is data, not instructions (§58).
10. Files in and out: attachments and generated documents, spreadsheets, and images in one artifact store (§28).
11. Planning and parallel work for complex requests (§22–23).
12. Checking important answers: selective verification (§24).
13. Reasoning effort: Auto, Fast, Balanced, Thorough (§15).
14. Stop means stop (§67).
15. Relevant tools only, capability-first tool IDs, permissions enforced outside the model (§16–19).
16. Background tasks use the same assistant and notify through Gjallarhorn; Ask with nobody watching (§30–31, §59).
17. Sharing the computer fairly (§60).
18. Specialized AIs and supporting models in routing (§61).
19. Connected services with credentials kept out of model context (§32).
20. Personalization of style and tools, separate from permissions (§38).

**Inspection, integration, and foundations**

21. The API gets the same assistant (§62).
22. What left this computer (§63).
23. Run details for advanced users (§35).
24. Profiles & Orchestration controls (§40, §56).
25. Structured output validation (§27).
26. Capability inventory (§37).
27. Quality test set (§64).
28. Caching (§36).
29. Versioned client contract (§68).

# Part XXX — Product Outcome

The intended long-term experience is:

```text
User asks Yggdrasil
        ↓
Yggdrasil understands the task
        ↓
recalls relevant context
        ↓
retrieves relevant knowledge
        ↓
chooses the right model
        ↓
chooses the right tools
        ↓
runs work on the right hardware
        ↓
recovers from failures
        ↓
checks the result
        ↓
returns a polished answer/artifact
```

The user should not need to know which model, provider, node, context strategy, or retry path made it possible.

> **Yggdrasil should be the intelligence layer around local models—not merely the program that starts them.**
